# trainScheduler

This project involves creating a train schedule application that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data. Your app retrieves and manipulates this information with Moment.js. This website will provide up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station. The user submits the Train Name, Destination First Train Time (in military time) and the Frequency (in minutes), the application calculates when the arrival of next train will arrive relative to the current time. Thanks Firebase this information is persistent is being continually updated. The user also has the ability of delete any information entered.
Note that this project also leverages Firebase to allow the user to login with either a Google or Github account.
